                <p>Hello!</p><p>I have a few slots open for new web or marketing technology clients in 2020, on an ongoing or project basis.</p><p>Are you a small or growing business or nonprofit looking to work closely with an experienced consultant to optimize your website, web application, or email efforts? If so, we might be a good&nbsp;fit!</p>
                <p>I&rsquo;m just as interested in how we work together and what we&rsquo;re working on as I am what technology we&rsquo;re using. It&rsquo;s about relationships, reliability, sustainability, and keeping overhead in check. If we can align on those values, I'm experienced in pivoting to support a broad range of&nbsp;capabilities.</p>
                <p>Over the past few years, Clearbold has:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Worked with Vermont-based Journey North to launch a new publishing/editorial platform on Drupal; undertake a significant hosting migration; modernize their Citizen Science database and online maps; upgrade website security&nbsp;protocols.</li>
                    <li>Helped a high-end, New England caterer&mdash;a long-time client&mdash;evaluate moving to Salesforce for CRM, establish email marketing and marketing automation campaigns, and launch a new e-commerce venture for online catering&nbsp;orders.</li>
                    <li>Released multiple Craft CMS plugins supporting integration with Campaign Monitor for email marketing &amp; marketing automation, and leveraged those plugins in multiple Clearbold client&nbsp;projects.</li>
                    <li>Launched 4 new client sites on Craft CMS in 2019&nbsp;alone.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If that&rsquo;s the sort of versatility and support your business or organization needs, I&rsquo;d love to talk. Please get in touch <a href="mailto:hello@clearbold.com">by&nbsp;email</a>.</p>
